# Unity Calc Namespace

While working in Unity I find it useful to have a centralized static class for doign common calculations over different types. The Calc namespace includes a number of sub-namespaces fro different types: Bool, Vector, Matrix, etc. 

To use this code, simply copy/paste the Calc folder to your Unity project. I have included DLLs for libraries required in the namespace as dependencies.

Make sure to keep the version.txt file. This is a way to remember the version of Calc in your project.
